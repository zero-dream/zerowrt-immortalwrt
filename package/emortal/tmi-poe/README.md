# Xiaomi TMI PoE control

`tmi-poe` controls the TMI7604R on Xiaomi P5 and the TMI7608R on Xiaomi P8.
It uses the board's QUP I2C controller and the named `poe-reset` GPIO. The
controller is matched by its device-tree node under `/sys/bus/i2c/devices`;
the I2C adapter number is not assumed to be zero.

`/etc/init.d/tmi-poe` starts the service at boot. Startup resets the PSE,
programs and verifies its configuration, then enables automatic af/at and
Class4+ PD detection and classification. It does not force power onto an
undetected device. Chip overcurrent, disconnect and thermal protection remain
in control of the powered ports; the driver does not override classification
current limits to make a PD draw more power.
Stopping the service shuts down all PoE outputs. Reloading a changed power
budget or Class4+ setting briefly shuts down outputs while updating it.

The chip datasheets describe IEEE 802.3af/at and a proprietary Class4+
extension, with up to 50 W advertised for the chip under the latter mode.
They do not claim IEEE 802.3bt support. Compatibility with a bt PD depends on
that PD's fallback/extension behavior; successful boot alone does not validate
bt negotiation or the PD's maximum rated load.

## Power budget

`/etc/config/tmi-poe` accepts `enabled`, `budget_mw`, `class4plus`, `debug`, and a list of
`disabled_ports` (`lan1`, `lan2`, etc.). WAN is never a PoE output.
If `budget_mw` is omitted, the original board budget is used:

| Board | Original supply | Board PoE budget |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P5 | 53 V / 1.25 A | 60,000 mW |
| P8 | 53 V / 2.3 A | 105,000 mW |

The supply ratings were provided for these Xiaomi devices. A smaller
replacement supply needs a lower explicit budget, allowing for the router's
own consumption and conversion losses. For P8 powered by the P5 supply,
30,000 mW is a conservative starting configuration used in the LAN2/C360
test; that test did not validate a continuous 30 W or multiport load.

```sh
uci set tmi-poe.main.budget_mw='30000'
uci commit tmi-poe
/etc/init.d/tmi-poe reload
```

Both supplies have the same nominal voltage. The PSE cannot identify the
adapter's rated current from its input-voltage reading. Its port readings
estimate PoE load, not total router input power or the supply's rated maximum.
No automatic adapter-rating detection is implemented.

`class4plus` defaults to `1`, including upgrades retaining the original UCI
file without this option. Set it to `0` only when restricting the controller
to standard af/at operation. No manual or semiautomatic control is needed.

## Diagnostics

`tmi-poe status` reports requested settings, actual port modes, supply and
power-good state in readable form. It reads hardware without resetting it,
enabling outputs, or consuming event latches. The shared controller lock
prevents it from observing a service's partial configuration/event update.
`tmi-poe status --debug` additionally reports the raw diagnostic snapshot:

- `requested-mask` / `requested-budget-mw`: the current UCI configuration.
- `hw-budget-raw`: the actual threshold register value; `hw-budget-nominal-mw`
  converts it using the factory nominal 53 V encoding, including quantization.
- `hw-detect` / `hw-classify` / `hw-class4plus` and each port's `mode`:
  hardware configuration.
- `powered` / `good`, detection/classification state, voltage and current:
  controller telemetry. Measurements have not been externally calibrated.

For ports with Class4+ enabled, current telemetry reports the raw ADC code
and both documented scales (`current-ma-at-1a`, `current-ma-at-2a`). The PDFs
specify 1.956 and 3.912 mA/LSB but omit the active-range status encoding.
Enabling Class4+ does not prove a particular PD was classified as Class4+;
the utility therefore labels the current scale unresolved and avoids a
misleading single current/power figure. This affects telemetry, not the chip's
automatic classification or hardware protection.

Requested settings can differ from hardware when a service failed to start,
is stopped, or has not reloaded changed UCI settings. `mode=shutdown` and
`powered=0 good=0` describe an off port even when `requested=1`.

Normal logs report initialization, I2C adapter readiness, reset sequence,
verified configuration, explicit global enable/disable and per-port transitions.
Opening the adapter does not prove that the PSE responds. Detection and
classification success are reported once automatic mode and powered/PGOOD
confirm successful negotiation. A classification event alone is reported as
an observation with an unconfirmed result. The repetitive detection-complete
latch alone does not advance the normal log.
Powered/PGOOD changes and documented disconnect, startup timeout,
overcurrent and current-limit events are described in words. Repeated
detection on an empty or non-PoE port, unchanged reloads and repeated faults
while waiting for recovery do not repeat normal logs. Continuous voltage and
current fluctuations do not generate normal logs. Fault recovery requires a
later powered/PGOOD sample without a newly reported fault. A DC-disconnect
event identifies the controller's load-disconnect observation, not proof of
a physical unplug. Power-off and power-good registers are read separately;
an off output with power-good still set is reported as shutdown unconfirmed.

On failure, the service still attempts output shutdown. An initialization or
reload error and its cleanup result are combined into one error record, keeping
the original stage and reason. Repeated I2C errors do not hide the final output
state: a failed cleanup explicitly reports it as unconfirmed. Normal SIGTERM
or SIGINT cancellation is not labeled a controller failure. Sampling failures
are logged on the first occurrence or when their details change; three
consecutive failures stop monitoring and initiate shutdown.

Each complete sample checks requested modes, detection/classification,
DC-disconnect protection, Class4+ and budget against hardware. A controller
reset or lost setting therefore cannot silently leave the service running
under different settings. A mismatch logs the affected setting and shuts down;
the service does not automatically reset or repower the controller. This adds
one ordinary protection-register read to each sample. Status queries remain
read-only and do not enforce policy. The checks do not reconstruct undocumented
registers or establish that every analog protection circuit is healthy.

The daemon consumes clear-on-read event aliases under its exclusive lock.
Successfully consumed events survive a later sample failure in memory; reads
that may clear an event are never retried. If an I2C transfer fails after the
chip cleared a latch, that event may be unavailable; the error is reported.
Events coalesced by hardware cannot reconstruct every edge or its exact time
between two-second polls. A sampled power-off/reconnect rearms per-port phase
messages. Multiple short changes may be summarized as an interruption already
recovered. Class decoding is not documented: `class=unconfirmed` is intentional,
and `negotiation=completed` requires automatic detection/classification active
and actual powered/PGOOD confirmation. A completion event alone does not prove
successful classification. The Class4+ enable setting is not a negotiated class.

Automatic hardware probing remains enabled while waiting. It is not triggered
by Ethernet carrier: a PD needs power before it can establish link, and carrier
can flap during boot without a PoE disconnect. Disable PoE on a port explicitly
if it must never probe. The chip's automatic protection is unchanged.

Raw registers, event bitmaps, ADC codes and verification expected/actual bytes
are emitted only at debug level when `debug=1`. Normal errors retain the
operation and readable failure reason. Debug-only changes do not interrupt
power. Enabling debug emits a baseline on the next successful sample, and a
reload that also changes policy enables requested diagnostics before applying
the hardware update. Identical consumed events in successive samples are each
visible in debug output:

```sh
uci set tmi-poe.main.debug='1'
uci commit tmi-poe
/etc/init.d/tmi-poe reload
logread -e tmi-poe
```

Set `debug` back to `0` and reload to stop raw diagnostics. A debug snapshot
can be requested with `tmi-poe status --debug` without changing configuration.

The P5/P8 reset pin's electrical defaults are applied with the I2C device's
pinctrl state after the TLMM provider has registered its functions. The
current kernel marks `gpio` as a GPIO function, allowing the userspace line
request while retaining the pin's 8 mA drive and pull-up configuration.
